To update your WLAN Pi, simply execute "sudo wlanpi-update".
Convert Wi-Fi channel numbers to center frequencies and vice versa on your WLAN Pi. Try "wifichannel 6", "wifichannel 229", "wifichannel 5500".
Are you using the right RF regulatory domain? Check by "sudo wlanpi-reg-domain get". Change by "sudo wlanpi-reg-domain set <country code>".
Change your WLAN Pi hostname using "sudo wlanpi-hostname set <new-hostname>"
Check if you are using the right time zone using "sudo wlanpi-timezone get". Change it using "sudo "wlanpi-timezone set Europe/London".
